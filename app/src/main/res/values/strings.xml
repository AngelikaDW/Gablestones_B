    <string name="about_gable_stones">Traditionally houses and mansions were decorated with gable stones: carved and painted stone tablets, fixed to the facade.
            Before Amsterdam introduced a system of street names, a building was referred to by its gable stone.
            Besides decorating the facade, a gable stone tells about the (former) owner, his profession or beliefs.
